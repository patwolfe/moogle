# Moogle

This is an implementation of the [Moogle Project](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos326/ass/a5.php) from Princeton's Function Programming course. I completed it to learn OCaml, as I had never written more than basic programs in it despite being very familiar with other languages in the ML family like SML.
